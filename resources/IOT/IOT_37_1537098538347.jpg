1
00:00:03,153 --> 00:00:08,207
I know it is hot, but you are here

2
00:00:08,207 --> 00:00:14,386
to honor your loved ones and Michelle and I

3
00:00:14,386 --> 00:00:16,636
could not be more honored

4
00:00:16,636 --> 00:00:21,005
to be here with you.

5
00:00:21,005 --> 00:00:23,687
You know it speaks to the complexity of

6
00:00:23,687 --> 00:00:25,386
American's time in Vietnam

7
00:00:25,386 --> 00:00:36,069
that even now, historians cannot agree on precisely when the war began.

8
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:38,386
American advisors had served there

9
00:00:38,386 --> 00:00:43,909
and died there as early as the mid 50s.

10
00:00:43,909 --> 00:00:46,990
Major combat operations would not begin until

11
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:51,803
the mid 60s.

12
00:00:51,803 --> 00:00:56,043
But if any year in between illustrated the changing nature

13
00:00:56,043 --> 00:01:02,320
of our involvement it was 1962.

14
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,505
It was January in Saigon.

15
00:01:06,505 --> 00:01:10,088
Army pilots strapped on their helmets

16
00:01:10,088 --> 00:01:13,380
and boarded their helicopters.

17
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,796
They lifted off, raced over treetops carrying the South Vietnamese troops.

18
00:01:19,728 --> 00:01:24,495
It was a single raid against an enemy stronghold

19
00:01:24,495 --> 00:01:29,045
just a few miles into the jungle, but it was one of

20
00:01:29,045 --> 00:01:34,964
America's first major operations in that faraway land.

21
00:01:34,964 --> 00:01:37,884
Fifty years later

22
00:01:37,884 --> 00:01:41,767
we come to this wall

23
00:01:41,767 --> 00:01:47,796
to this sacred place to remember.

24
00:01:47,796 --> 00:01:50,712
We can step towards its granite wall,

25
00:01:50,712 --> 00:01:56,868
reach out, and touch a name.

26
00:01:56,868 --> 00:01:58,827
Today is Memorial Day

27
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:02,064
when we recall all those who gave everything

28
00:02:02,064 --> 00:02:05,677
in the darkness of war so we can stand here

29
00:02:05,677 --> 00:02:09,713
in the glory of spring.

30
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:17,379
Today begins the fiftieth commemoration of our war in Vietnam.

31
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:18,645
We honor each

32
00:02:18,645 --> 00:02:23,301
of those names etched in stone:

33
00:02:23,301 --> 00:02:29,538
58, 282 American patriots.

34
00:02:29,538 --> 00:02:35,207
We salute all who served with them.

35
00:02:35,207 --> 00:02:42,327
We stand with the families who love them still.

36
00:02:42,327 --> 00:02:48,383
For years you've come here to be with them once more

37
00:02:48,383 --> 00:02:51,345
and in the simple things you've left behind:

38
00:02:51,345 --> 00:02:59,048
your offerings, your momentos, your gifts, we get a glimpse

39
00:02:59,048 --> 00:03:03,129
of the lives they led:

40
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:07,081
the blanket that covered him as a baby

41
00:03:07,081 --> 00:03:11,260
the baseball bat he swung as a boy

42
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:17,914
a wedding ring, a photo of the grandchild he never met

43
00:03:17,914 --> 00:03:24,222
boots he wore, still caked in mud,

44
00:03:24,222 --> 00:03:29,664
the medals she earned still shining,

45
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:33,676
and of course some of the things left here have special meaning

46
00:03:33,676 --> 00:03:36,318
known only to the veterans:

47
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:40,861
a can of beer, a packet of M&amp;M's,

48
00:03:40,861 --> 00:03:44,143
a container of spam,

49
00:03:44,143 --> 00:03:47,023
an old field ration

50
00:03:47,023 --> 00:03:51,113
still good, still awful.

51
00:03:51,113 --> 00:03:58,681
It's here we feel the depth of your sacrifice

52
00:03:58,681 --> 00:04:03,577
and here we see a piece of our larger American story.

53
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:08,945
Our founders in their genius gave us a task.

54
00:04:08,945 --> 00:04:12,310
They set out to make a more perfect union.

55
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:18,315
So it falls to every generation to carry on that work,

56
00:04:18,315 --> 00:04:22,317
to keep moving forward, to overcome

57
00:04:22,317 --> 00:04:25,814
the sometimes painful past,

58
00:04:25,814 --> 00:04:30,735
to keep striving for our ideals.

59
00:04:30,735 --> 00:04:34,110
And one of the most painful chapters of our history

60
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,027
was Vietnam.

61
00:04:36,027 --> 00:04:41,480
Most particularly how we treated our troops

62
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:46,334
who served there.

63
00:04:46,334 --> 00:04:49,580
You were often blamed for a war you didn't start

64
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,448
when you should have been commended for serving

65
00:04:52,448 --> 00:04:56,897
your country with valor.

66
00:04:56,897 --> 00:05:00,729
You are sometimes blamed for misdeeds of a few

67
00:05:00,729 --> 00:05:09,326
[clapping]

68
00:05:09,326 --> 00:05:11,622
when the honorable service of the many

69
00:05:11,622 --> 00:05:14,168
should have been praised,

70
00:05:14,168 --> 00:05:18,275
you came home and sometimes were denigrated

71
00:05:18,275 --> 00:05:23,478
when you should have been celebrated.

72
00:05:23,478 --> 00:05:27,111
It was a national shame,

73
00:05:27,111 --> 00:05:32,261
a disgrace that should have never happened.

74
00:05:32,261 --> 00:05:35,610
That's why here today we resolve

75
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,784
that it will not happen again

76
00:05:37,784 --> 00:05:47,221
[clapping]

77
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:50,219
So a central part of this fiftieth anniversary

78
00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:52,801
will be to tell your story as it should have been told

79
00:05:52,801 --> 00:05:55,671
all along.

80
00:05:55,671 --> 00:06:00,868
It's another chance to set the record straight.

81
00:06:00,868 --> 00:06:02,536
That's one more way we keep perfecting

82
00:06:02,536 --> 00:06:04,486
our union.

83
00:06:04,486 --> 00:06:08,001
Setting the record straight and it starts today.

84
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:12,451
Because history will honor your service.

85
00:06:12,451 --> 00:06:15,000
Your names will join a story of service

86
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,368
that stretches back two centuries.

87
00:06:20,368 --> 00:06:23,534
Let us tell the story of a generation of service members

88
00:06:23,534 --> 00:06:25,368
every color, every creed,

89
00:06:25,368 --> 00:06:29,135
rich, poor, officer and enlisted who served

90
00:06:29,135 --> 00:06:31,722
with just as much patriotism and honor

91
00:06:31,722 --> 00:06:36,219
as any before you.

92
00:06:36,219 --> 00:06:38,401
Let's never forget that most of those who served

93
00:06:39,692 --> 00:06:40,984
in Vietnam did so by choice.

94
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:44,369
So many of you volunteered.

95
00:06:44,369 --> 00:06:45,769
The country was at war and you said

96
00:06:45,769 --> 00:06:48,886
"Send me!".

97
00:06:48,886 --> 00:06:51,370
That includes our women in Vietnam.

98
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,969
Every one of you a volunteer.

99
00:06:52,969 --> 00:07:01,652
[clapping]

100
00:07:01,652 --> 00:07:03,937
Those who were drafted, they too went and

101
00:07:03,937 --> 00:07:09,054
carried their burden. You served.

102
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,487
You did your duty.

103
00:07:11,487 --> 00:07:13,636
You persevered through some of the most

104
00:07:13,636 --> 00:07:18,470
brutal conditions ever faced by Americans at war:

105
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:23,272
the suffocating heat, the drenching monsoon rains,

106
00:07:23,272 --> 00:07:25,254
an enemy that would come out of nowhere

107
00:07:25,254 --> 00:07:28,353
and could vanish just as quickly.

108
00:07:28,353 --> 00:07:31,803
Some of the most intense urban combat in history.

109
00:07:31,803 --> 00:07:33,758
in battles for a single hill that could rage for weeks.

110
00:07:37,387 --> 00:07:39,819
Let it be said that in those hell holes

111
00:07:39,819 --> 00:07:43,853
like Briar Patch, and the Zoo, and the Hanoi Hilton.

112
00:07:43,853 --> 00:07:46,437
Our Vietnam POWs didn't simply endure.

113
00:07:46,437 --> 00:07:49,319
You wrote some of the most extraordinary stories

114
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:52,386
of bravery and integrity in the annals of military history.

115
00:07:52,386 --> 00:08:02,353
[clapping]

116
00:08:02,353 --> 00:08:05,972
As a nation, we've long celebrated the courage

117
00:08:05,972 --> 00:08:11,037
of our forces in Normandy, and Iwo Jima,

118
00:08:11,037 --> 00:08:16,004
Pusainne perimeter, and Heartbreak Ridge.

119
00:08:16,004 --> 00:08:18,986
So let us also speak of your courage

120
00:08:18,986 --> 00:08:21,786
at Way and Caysain, Tain Sinnu, and Saigon.

121
00:08:21,786 --> 00:08:32,553
From Hamburger Hill to Rolling Thunder.

122
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,920
All too often it is forgotten that you, our troops

123
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:38,088
in Vietnam, won every major battle you fought in.

124
00:08:38,088 --> 00:08:50,069
[clapping]

125
00:08:50,069 --> 00:08:51,472
When you came home I know many of you put your

126
00:08:51,472 --> 00:08:54,769
medals away, tucked them in a drawer;

127
00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:58,754
or a box in the closet. You went on with your lives.

128
00:08:58,754 --> 00:09:03,688
You started families and pursued careers.

129
00:09:03,688 --> 00:09:06,903
A lot of you didn't talk too much about your service.

130
00:09:06,903 --> 00:09:09,136
As a consequence, this nation has not always

131
00:09:09,136 --> 00:09:11,969
fully appreciated the chapter

132
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:16,920
of your lives that came next.

133
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,920
So let us also tell the story of a generation

134
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,403
that came home and how, even though some Americans

135
00:09:22,403 --> 00:09:24,553
turned their back on you, you never

136
00:09:24,553 --> 00:09:26,286
turned your back on America.

137
00:09:26,286 --> 00:09:35,219
[clapping]

138
00:09:35,219 --> 00:09:36,754
Like generations before you

139
00:09:36,754 --> 00:09:38,486
you took off the uniform, but

140
00:09:38,486 --> 00:09:41,153
you never stopped serving.

141
00:09:41,153 --> 00:09:45,902
You became teachers, police officers and nurses,

142
00:09:45,902 --> 00:09:49,731
the folks we count on every single day.

143
00:09:49,731 --> 00:09:52,286
You became entrepreneurs, running companies, and

144
00:09:52,286 --> 00:09:56,719
pioneering industries that changed the world.

145
00:09:56,719 --> 00:09:59,469
You became leaders and public servants,

146
00:09:59,469 --> 00:10:03,670
from town halls to Capitol Hill,

147
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,287
lifting up our communities, our states,

148
00:10:06,287 --> 00:10:09,136
our nation.

149
00:10:09,136 --> 00:10:12,086
You reminded us what it was like to serve,

150
00:10:12,086 --> 00:10:14,670
what it meant to serve.

151
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:17,036
And those of you who stayed in uniform,

152
00:10:17,036 --> 00:10:19,286
you rose through the ranks and became

153
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:21,519
leaders in every service, learned

154
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,603
from your experience in Vietnam, and

155
00:10:23,603 --> 00:10:25,719
rebuilt our military into the finest force

156
00:10:25,719 --> 00:10:28,486
that the World has ever known.

157
00:10:28,486 --> 00:10:36,069
[clapping]

158
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:39,486
And let's remember all those Vietnam veterans

159
00:10:39,486 --> 00:10:41,986
who came back and served again

160
00:10:41,986 --> 00:10:44,886
in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

161
00:10:44,886 --> 00:10:47,886
You did not stop serving!

162
00:10:47,886 --> 00:10:52,769
[clapping]

163
00:10:52,769 --> 00:10:56,403
Even as you succeeded in all these endeavours,

164
00:10:56,403 --> 00:10:59,119
you did something more.

165
00:10:59,119 --> 00:11:02,004
Maybe the most important thing you did:

166
00:11:02,004 --> 00:11:04,886
you looked after each other.

167
00:11:04,886 --> 00:11:06,268
When your government didn't live up

168
00:11:06,268 --> 00:11:09,318
to its responsibilities, you spoke out.

169
00:11:09,318 --> 00:11:11,886
Fighting for the care and benefits you had earned,

170
00:11:11,886 --> 00:11:17,337
over time transforming the VA.

171
00:11:17,337 --> 00:11:19,603
And of course, one of these Vietnam veterans,

172
00:11:19,603 --> 00:11:21,420
is now our outstanding Secretary

173
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:31,819
of Veterans Affairs, Eric K. Shinseki.

174
00:11:31,819 --> 00:11:34,468
You looked after one another.

175
00:11:34,468 --> 00:11:38,019
You cared for one another.

176
00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:40,953
People weren't always talking about PTSD at the time.

177
00:11:40,953 --> 00:11:42,568
You understood it

178
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:46,953
and you were there for each other.

179
00:11:46,953 --> 00:11:48,469
And just as importantly, you didn't just

180
00:11:48,469 --> 00:11:50,536
take care of your own,

181
00:11:50,536 --> 00:11:56,020
you cared for those that followed.

182
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,137
You made it your mission to

183
00:11:57,137 --> 00:12:00,319
make sure today's troops get the respect

184
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:03,987
and support that all too often you did not receive.

185
00:12:03,987 --> 00:12:11,569
[clapping]

186
00:12:11,569 --> 00:12:14,991
Because of you, because our Vietnam veterans

187
00:12:14,991 --> 00:12:19,353
led the charge, the post 9/11 GI Bill is

188
00:12:19,353 --> 00:12:21,920
helping hundreds of thousands of todays veterans

189
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,670
go to college and pursue their dreams.

190
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:28,255
[clapping]

191
00:12:28,255 --> 00:12:31,769
Because of you, because you didn't let us forget,

192
00:12:31,769 --> 00:12:34,170
at our airports our returning troops

193
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,570
get off the airplane and you are there

194
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:39,203
to shake their hands.

195
00:12:39,203 --> 00:12:43,019
[clapping]

196
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:45,088
Because of you across America

197
00:12:45,088 --> 00:12:47,437
communities have welcomed home our forces

198
00:12:47,437 --> 00:12:48,970
from Iraq.

199
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:51,436
And when our troops return from Afghanistan

200
00:12:51,436 --> 00:12:54,619
America will give this entire 9/11 generation

201
00:12:54,619 --> 00:12:56,986
the welcome home they deserve

202
00:12:56,986 --> 00:12:59,453
that happened in part because of you.

203
00:12:59,453 --> 00:13:08,469
[clapping]

204
00:13:08,469 --> 00:13:13,270
This is the story of our Vietnam service members.

205
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:16,203
The story that needs to be told.

206
00:13:16,203 --> 00:13:20,137
This is what this 50th anniversary is all about.

207
00:13:20,137 --> 00:13:21,686
It's another opportunity to say to our

208
00:13:21,686 --> 00:13:26,236
Vietnam veterans what we should have been saying

209
00:13:26,236 --> 00:13:27,256
from the beginning.

210
00:13:27,256 --> 00:13:29,505
You did your job.

211
00:13:29,505 --> 00:13:32,604
You served with honor.

212
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:35,640
You made us proud.

213
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,869
You came home and you helped build the America

214
00:13:38,869 --> 00:13:42,873
that we love and that we cherish.

215
00:13:42,873 --> 00:13:45,636
So here today it must be said,

216
00:13:45,636 --> 00:13:51,404
you have earned your place among the greatest generations.

217
00:13:51,404 --> 00:13:55,136
At this time I would ask all our Vietnam veterans.

218
00:13:55,136 --> 00:13:58,154
Those of you who can stand, please stand.

219
00:13:58,154 --> 00:14:01,272
All those already standing, raise your hands

220
00:14:01,272 --> 00:14:04,803
as we say those simple words which always

221
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:09,237
greet our troops when they come home from here on out.

222
00:14:09,237 --> 00:14:11,054
Welcome home!

223
00:14:11,054 --> 00:14:13,186
[clapping]

224
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,204
Welcome home!

225
00:14:14,204 --> 00:14:16,353
[clapping]

226
00:14:16,353 --> 00:14:17,687
Welcome home!

227
00:14:17,687 --> 00:14:19,286
[clapping]

228
00:14:19,286 --> 00:14:21,504
Thank you!

229
00:14:21,504 --> 00:14:23,736
We appreciate you!

230
00:14:23,736 --> 00:14:34,186
Welcome home!

231
00:14:34,186 --> 00:14:36,102
Today we're calling on all Americans

232
00:14:36,102 --> 00:14:40,372
and every segment of our society to join this effort.

233
00:14:40,372 --> 00:14:44,670
Everybody can do something!

234
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:47,053
5 decades removed from the time of division

235
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:49,405
among Americans, this anniversary can

236
00:14:49,405 --> 00:14:55,136
remind us of what we share as Americans.

237
00:14:55,136 --> 00:14:56,369
That includes honoring our Vietnam veterans

238
00:14:56,369 --> 00:15:01,157
by never forgetting the lessons of that war.

239
00:15:01,157 --> 00:15:03,137
So let us resolve that when America sends

240
00:15:03,137 --> 00:15:05,686
our sons and daughters into harms way

241
00:15:05,686 --> 00:15:08,037
We will always give them a clear mission.

242
00:15:08,037 --> 00:15:11,254
We will always give them a sound strategy.

243
00:15:11,254 --> 00:15:13,405
We will give them the equipment they need

244
00:15:13,405 --> 00:15:14,803
to get the job done,

245
00:15:14,803 --> 00:15:16,987
and we willl have their backs.

246
00:15:16,987 --> 00:15:24,171
[clapping]

247
00:15:24,171 --> 00:15:26,187
We will resolve that leaders will be candid

248
00:15:26,187 --> 00:15:28,320
about the risks and about progress, and

249
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,140
have a plan to bring a our troops home

250
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,954
with honor.

251
00:15:33,954 --> 00:15:37,370
Let us resolve to never forget the costs of war

252
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:41,953
including the terrible loss of innocent civilians

253
00:15:41,953 --> 00:15:45,171
not just in Vietnam but in all wars.

254
00:15:45,171 --> 00:15:47,255
We know that while your sacrifice of service

255
00:15:47,255 --> 00:15:48,688
is the very definition of glory,

256
00:15:48,688 --> 00:15:53,935
war itself is not glorious.

257
00:15:53,935 --> 00:15:56,053
We hate war.

258
00:15:56,053 --> 00:15:59,352
When we fight we do so to protect ourselves

259
00:15:59,352 --> 00:16:03,488
because it's necessary.

260
00:16:03,488 --> 00:16:05,480
Let's resolve that in our democracy

261
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:09,368
we can debate and disagree even in a time of war

262
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:11,023
but let us never use patriotism

263
00:16:11,023 --> 00:16:14,169
as a political sword.

264
00:16:14,169 --> 00:16:15,768
Patriots can support a war.

265
00:16:15,768 --> 00:16:17,904
Patriots can oppose a war.

266
00:16:17,904 --> 00:16:19,256
And whatever our view, let us always

267
00:16:19,256 --> 00:16:21,768
stand united in support of our troops

268
00:16:21,768 --> 00:16:24,222
who we've placed in harms way.

269
00:16:24,222 --> 00:16:25,404
[clapping]

270
00:16:25,404 --> 00:16:37,369
That is our solemn obligation.

271
00:16:37,369 --> 00:16:39,086
Let's resolve to take care of our veterans

272
00:16:39,086 --> 00:16:41,987
as well as they've taken care of us.

273
00:16:41,987 --> 00:16:48,686
Not just talk, but actions.

274
00:16:48,686 --> 00:16:51,752
Not just in the first 5 years after a war

275
00:16:51,752 --> 00:16:56,335
but the first five decades.

276
00:16:56,335 --> 00:16:57,820
For our Vietnam veterans this means

277
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:01,320
the disability benefits for diseases

278
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,904
connected to Agent Orange.

279
00:17:04,904 --> 00:17:07,003
It means job opportunities and mental health care

280
00:17:07,003 --> 00:17:10,802
to help you stand tall again.

281
00:17:10,802 --> 00:17:14,386
It means ending the tragedy of veterans homelessness so

282
00:17:14,386 --> 00:17:16,303
that every veteran who has fought for America

283
00:17:16,303 --> 00:17:18,603
has a home in America.

284
00:17:18,603 --> 00:17:20,003
You shouldn't have to fight for a roof over

285
00:17:20,003 --> 00:17:22,253
your heads when you fought on behalf of the country

286
00:17:22,253 --> 00:17:24,153
that you love.

287
00:17:24,153 --> 00:17:31,788
[clapping and whistling]

288
00:17:31,788 --> 00:17:35,103
And when an American does not come back

289
00:17:35,103 --> 00:17:39,268
including the 1666 Americans still missing

290
00:17:39,268 --> 00:17:42,768
from the Vietnam war, let us resolve to do

291
00:17:42,768 --> 00:17:46,719
everything in our power to bring them home.

292
00:17:46,719 --> 00:17:48,219
This is our solemn promise

293
00:17:48,219 --> 00:17:52,052
to mothers like Sarah Shay who joins us today,

294
00:17:52,052 --> 00:17:57,236
93 years old, who has honored her son

295
00:17:57,236 --> 00:18:00,502
Major Donald Shay Jr., missing in action

296
00:18:00,502 --> 00:18:03,703
for 42 years, there she is.

297
00:18:03,703 --> 00:18:05,936
Sarah, thank you for your courage.

298
00:18:05,936 --> 00:18:07,368
God bless you.

299
00:18:07,368 --> 00:18:31,518
[clapping]

300
00:18:31,518 --> 00:18:33,153
This is the promise we're fulfilling today

301
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:34,936
to the Moroni family

302
00:18:35,927 --> 00:18:36,918
of Fayetteville, Arkansas.

303
00:18:36,918 --> 00:18:41,669
43 years after he went missing, we can announce

304
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:43,654
that army captain Virgil Moroni III

305
00:18:43,654 --> 00:18:46,886
is coming home and

306
00:18:46,886 --> 00:18:49,320
he will finally rest in peace.

307
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:55,285
[clapping]

308
00:18:55,285 --> 00:18:58,352
You know, some have called this war era

309
00:18:58,352 --> 00:19:00,519
a scar on our country

310
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:03,502
but here's what I say.

311
00:19:03,502 --> 00:19:05,453
As any wound heals, the tissue around it

312
00:19:05,453 --> 00:19:12,553
because tougher, becomes stronger than before.

313
00:19:12,553 --> 00:19:16,635
And in this sense, finally, we might begin to see

314
00:19:16,635 --> 00:19:20,089
the true legacy of Vietnam.

315
00:19:20,089 --> 00:19:22,706
Because of Vietnam and our veterans

316
00:19:22,706 --> 00:19:25,722
we now use American power smarter.

317
00:19:25,722 --> 00:19:28,472
We honor our military more.

318
00:19:28,472 --> 00:19:31,522
We take care of our veterans better.

319
00:19:31,522 --> 00:19:33,689
Because of the hard lessons of Vietnam,

320
00:19:33,689 --> 00:19:34,788
because of you,

321
00:19:34,788 --> 00:19:37,189
America is stronger than before.

322
00:19:37,189 --> 00:19:44,739
[clapping]

323
00:19:44,739 --> 00:19:46,705
And finally, on this anniversary

324
00:19:46,705 --> 00:19:48,906
and all the years to come

325
00:19:48,906 --> 00:19:54,389
let us remember what binds us as one people.

326
00:19:54,389 --> 00:19:55,822
It is important for all of us -

327
00:19:55,822 --> 00:19:57,488
whether you fought in the Vietnam war,

328
00:19:57,488 --> 00:19:59,205
or fought against it,

329
00:19:59,205 --> 00:20:02,056
whether you were too young to be shaped by it.

330
00:20:02,056 --> 00:20:06,039
It is important that our children understand

331
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:08,556
the sacrifices that were made by our troops

332
00:20:08,556 --> 00:20:10,307
in Vietnam.

333
00:20:10,307 --> 00:20:11,888
That for them this is more than just

334
00:20:11,888 --> 00:20:14,675
a name in the history books.

335
00:20:14,675 --> 00:20:16,955
It's important that we know the lesson

336
00:20:16,955 --> 00:20:21,524
of a gift once left at this memorial.

337
00:20:21,524 --> 00:20:22,674
It was towards the end of the day

338
00:20:22,674 --> 00:20:24,711
and most of the tourists and visitors had departed

339
00:20:24,711 --> 00:20:29,023
and there it was.

340
00:20:29,023 --> 00:20:32,858
A football helmet, black with white stripes,

341
00:20:32,858 --> 00:20:34,924
and a wrist band,

342
00:20:34,924 --> 00:20:38,789
and with them was a handwritten note.

343
00:20:38,789 --> 00:20:42,439
It was from a young man, still in high school.

344
00:20:42,439 --> 00:20:43,988
I remind you this was more than 2 decades

345
00:20:43,988 --> 00:20:45,373
after Vietnam. That high school student

346
00:20:45,373 --> 00:20:50,674
was born years after the war had already ended.

347
00:20:50,674 --> 00:20:52,538
But in that short hand-written note,

348
00:20:52,538 --> 00:20:55,239
he captured the reverence

349
00:20:55,239 --> 00:20:57,072
that bonds between generations

350
00:20:57,072 --> 00:20:59,888
that bring us here today.

351
00:20:59,888 --> 00:21:01,290
The letter began.

352
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:03,674
" Dear Vietnam veterans,

353
00:21:03,674 --> 00:21:05,476
Here are two things from me,

354
00:21:05,476 --> 00:21:10,605
to you, that I think you should have."

355
00:21:10,605 --> 00:21:12,240
He explained that it was his helmet

356
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,989
from midget football, and his wristband

357
00:21:16,989 --> 00:21:20,258
from his senior year.

358
00:21:20,258 --> 00:21:24,889
So today I want to close with the words he wrote.

359
00:21:24,889 --> 00:21:26,558
In these two pieces of equipment

360
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:28,272
I was allowed to make mistakes,

361
00:21:28,272 --> 00:21:34,105
correct them, grow, and mature as a person.

362
00:21:34,105 --> 00:21:39,023
However, that was on my battlefield.

363
00:21:39,023 --> 00:21:41,972
You, didn't get the chance to do that

364
00:21:41,972 --> 00:21:45,506
on your battlefield.

365
00:21:45,506 --> 00:21:48,969
Some of you were forced to grow up too fast.

366
00:21:48,969 --> 00:21:52,686
All of you died too soon.

367
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:55,770
We do have many things in common though.

368
00:21:55,770 --> 00:22:00,987
We both have pride, heart, and determination.

369
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:03,219
I'm just sorry you guys had to learn those qualities

370
00:22:03,219 --> 00:22:05,820
too fast.

371
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,587
And that is why i'm giving you

372
00:22:07,587 --> 00:22:09,821
what I grew up with.

373
00:22:09,821 --> 00:22:11,853
You are true heroes,

374
00:22:11,853 --> 00:22:14,404
and you will never be forgotten.

375
00:22:14,404 --> 00:22:18,820
That's from a high school kid

376
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:23,204
born decades after the end of the war.

377
00:22:23,204 --> 00:22:25,336
And that captures the spirit

378
00:22:25,336 --> 00:22:30,920
that this entire country should embrace.

379
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:34,320
Veterans and families of the Vietnam war,

380
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,803
I know the wounds of war are slow to heal.

381
00:22:37,803 --> 00:22:41,219
You know that better than most.

382
00:22:41,219 --> 00:22:43,953
But today we take another step.

383
00:22:43,953 --> 00:22:46,888
The task of telling your story continues.

384
00:22:46,888 --> 00:22:50,254
The work of perfecting our union goes on.

385
00:22:50,254 --> 00:22:52,003
And decades from now

386
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:55,421
I hope another young American will visit this place

387
00:22:55,421 --> 00:23:00,908
and reach out and touch a name

388
00:23:00,908 --> 00:23:03,437
and she'll learn the story of service members,

389
00:23:03,437 --> 00:23:04,936
people she never met,

390
00:23:04,936 --> 00:23:07,719
who fought a war she never knew.

391
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:10,219
And in that moment of understanding

392
00:23:10,219 --> 00:23:12,919
of gratitude,

393
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:15,470
and of grace,

394
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:18,336
your legacy will endure.

395
00:23:18,336 --> 00:23:22,286
For you are ALL, true heroes.

396
00:23:22,286 --> 00:23:25,269
And you will ALL be remembered.

397
00:23:25,269 --> 00:23:26,889
May God bless you.

398
00:23:26,889 --> 00:23:28,670
May God bless your families.

399
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:31,753
May God bless our men and women in uniform.

400
00:23:31,753 --> 00:23:35,036
And may God bless these United States of America.
